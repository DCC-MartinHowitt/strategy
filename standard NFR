# DRAFT Generic Set of DCC Browser Based Requirements #

## 1. Purpose ##

1. 	To ensure the basic DCC ICT requirements are 	checked by the business before they procure their 	own software when ICT Services are not involved 	with the procurement.
 
2. 	As a basis for the development of detailed 	requirements for a new system when ICT Service are 	working with the business area to procure the best 	system. 
 
During the tender process the term ‘Supplier’ refers to the tenderer.

## 2. General Requirements ##

1.	The system must act as the Authority’s **XXXYYY**. 
2.	The application must capture and store details in a consistent manner.
3.	Added value beyond the features and facilities described in the specification should be demonstrated as part of the contract.
4.	The application must be user friendly, intuitive and the screens/interfaces should be universally familiar to anyone who regularly uses the internet and require minimal training to use.
5.	The application should streamline processes, i.e. no duplication of the inputting of information.
6.	The application must be ready to integrate at no extra cost with all other DCC systems holding related service data.
7.	The application must be capable of phased implementation on a function by function basis over a period of time, should this be necessary.
8.	The application must enable the Authority to fully comply with the Data Protection Act 1998.
9.	The supplier must demonstrate a commitment to shaping the application in response to emerging technologies through a product roadmap or similar.
10.	The application should work with social media, if applicable.

## 3. Technical Architecture ##

In order to maximise the reuse of data, software, process and service components it is expected that the layers that comprise the system will be decoupled from each other as shown in diagram 1.0 below. The scope of this procurement is expected to be broadly limited to parts of the central three layers shown – databases, web services, and process management.

Diagram 1.0 shows the external supporting functions that need to enable, or be enabled by, the new system. Specifically:-

1.	The system must use standards-based web services to communicate internally and externally.
2.	The system must integrate with other applications related to the service, and be intuitive to guide the user through the processes.
3.	The system must utilise mobile technology and be as functional on mobile platforms as on desktop or tablet form-factor devices. 
4.	The system must be easily cross referenced with other systems and the data available for dynamic access by other systems.
5.	The system must be hosted on public cloud infrastructure with no client device dependencies beyond browser compatibility.
6.	The system should utilise standard Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence infrastructure to enable reports to be created.

## 4. Remote Access ##

Secure access to user session "shadowing" tools may be permitted if they can be implemented in compliance with standard local government security compliance requirements. 

## 5. Desktop Applications ##

Microsoft Office is the approved integrated office suite incorporating word processing, spreadsheet, diary/calendar and graphics facilities.  Currently the Authority utilises Microsoft Office 2010.
a)	Where office integration is necessary the system should integrate into individual Microsoft applications. E.g. Outlook to follow task from the application, but it is preferred that Workflow tools should be independent from email in operation to allow maximum device and platform interoperability.

## 6. Groupware / Internet ##

Microsoft Office Outlook (currently 2010) is the approved groupware software.  
a)	Internet Explorer is the standard corporate browser at present and the proposed system must cope with subsequent upgrades.

## 7. ‘e-GIF’ Standards (e-Government Interoperability Framework) and other standards ##

The e-Government Interoperability Framework (e-Gif) sets out Government policies and standards for achieving interoperability and seamless information across Government (including local government). The Authority is mandated to introduce the standards set out in the framework for all new systems, or other systems, which are part of electronic service delivery and will need to comply with the standards. 

A full copy of the directive can be obtained from:-

1.	The software must ensure any information entered is retained if any device runs out of power or hibernates.
2.	The application must hold full functionality to include all applicable standards requirements..
3.	The Supplier must provide details of any software licence agreements and service level agreements that you propose.
